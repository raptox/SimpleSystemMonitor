This little tool is intended to show me the current CPU/GPU temperatures and loads.

A dozen of tools exist already for this simple task, but I needed something small and most importantly, it needed to show me the actual time/date, because this will be running on my 2nd screen.

This is my first Visual Studio Project ever, which I just quickly read up on the internet on how to accomplish these tasks in Windows as fast and simple as possible.

I use [Open Hardware Monitor](https://openhardwaremonitor.org/) for this.
